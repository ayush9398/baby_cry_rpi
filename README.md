# Baby cry detection, on the Raspberry Pi side

Recognition of baby cry from audio signal

The aim is to automatically recognize a baby crying while sleeping. In such case, a lullaby is started to calm the baby
down.

This is done by implementing a machine learning algorithm on a Raspberry Pi.

This repo should be cloned on the Rapsberry Pi in `/opt/`.

To make it work, you need to do 3 things:
+ use a Raspberry Pi 2B (for the moment), with
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/debian/) installed

+ put `model.pkl` generated by [baby_cry_detection](https://github.com/giulbia/baby_cry_detection) in folder
 `model`

+ put the _egg_ file `baby_cry_detection-x.x-py2.7.egg`
generated by [baby_cry_detection](https://github.com/giulbia/baby_cry_detection) in folder `lib`
